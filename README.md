# Median-Statistics-estimate-of-the-neutron-lifetime
Generated Error Distributions for the neutron lifetime using a subset of measurements compiled in the 2018edition of Particle Data Group (PDG){Checked the Gaussianity of the error distribution using the weighted mean as well as median estimate. We findthe Studentâ€™s t and cauchy distributions to provide a better fit in case of median statistics.
